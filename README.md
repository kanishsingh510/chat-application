## Real-Time Chat App (Frontend Only)

### Description

This is a **responsive, frontend-only real-time chat application** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, with **WebSocket** support via a public echo server. The application simulates real-time communication where users can send and receive messages instantly, all within the browser — **no backend required**.

The user interface is clean, minimal, and inspired by modern messaging apps. It also includes a **light/dark theme toggle** using the 🌓 emoji, providing a pleasant experience in both bright and low-light environments.



### Features

*  **Real-Time Messaging** (via WebSocket Echo Server)
*  **Light and Dark Theme Toggle** (🌓 emoji, with CSS variables)
*  **Responsive Design** (works on desktops, tablets, and phones)
*  **Frontend Only** – No backend required
*  **Auto-Scroll** to latest messages
*  **Modern UI** with smooth layout and full-height chat area


### How It Works

* Messages are sent to a public WebSocket echo server (`wss://echo.websocket.events`)
* The server sends back the same message to simulate a live conversation
* The chat interface displays messages as if they were part of a live chat
* The 🌓 emoji toggles between **light** and **dark** themes using CSS custom properties


### Technologies Used

* HTML5 (Structure)
* CSS3 (Styling & Theming with CSS Variables)
* JavaScript (WebSocket API, DOM Manipulation)
